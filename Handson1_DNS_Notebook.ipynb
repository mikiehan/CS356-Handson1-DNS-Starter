    "This is an individual assignment. In this hands-on exercise, you will get to explore DNS. Prior to working on this exercise, watch all videos under [Canvas -> Panopto Videos -> DNS](https://utexas.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=600b7676-8786-478d-998e-ac9200a0ea56), which will help you finish this exericse (especially the last 2 videos). In this write up, you will first read a quick introduction on the tools we use to work with DNS. After that, you will answer some short questions. The instructions for submission, are at the end of this page.  \n",

    "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "<code>dig</code> performs a DNS lookup and prints information about the request and the response it received. If you run dig, you may see results that differ from those presented here. At the bottom, we can see that the query was sent to our default server (128.83.130.204), and that it took roughly 25 milliseconds to respond. Most of the information we are interested in is in the ANSWER section.\n",

    "We can see that this result is of type A, an address record: it is telling us that there are 4 IP addresses for the name \"cnn.com\". The expiry time field \"60\" indicates that this record/entry is valid for 60 seconds. You can ignore the \"class\" field; this is nearly always IN for Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can ask a specific server (instead of the default) for information about a host by using the following syntax. \n",
    "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "<img width=550 src=\"figures/dig_cnn_auth.png\">\n",
    "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "Above result shows AUTHORITY SECTION because we have queried on one of the authoritative servers. The AUTHORITY section contains records of type NS, indicating the names of DNS servers that have name records for a particular domain. Here, we can see that four DNS servers (ns-47.awsdns-05.com., ns-576.awsdns-08.net., ns-1630.awsdns-11.co.uk. and ns-1086.awsdns-07.org.) are responsible for answering requests for names in the cnn.com domain. \n",
    "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "The <code>rd</code> (recursion desired) flag indicates that <code>dig</code> requested a recursive lookup, and the <code>ra</code> (recursion available) flag indicates that the server permits recursive lookups (some do not).\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>dig</code> only prints the final result of the recursive search. You can mimic the individual steps of a recursive search by sending a request to a particular DNS server and asking for no recursion, using the +norecurse flag. For example, to send a non-recursive query to one of the root servers: \n",
    "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "<img width=570 src=\"figures/dig_cnn_norecurse.png\">\n",
    "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "As you can see, the server does not know the answer and instead provides information about the servers most likely to be able to provide authoritative information. In this case, the best the root server knows is the identities of the servers for the com. domain. "
